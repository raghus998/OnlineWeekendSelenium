TestNG : Unit Testing FrameWork 

In Automation the script which is not having verfication code then that script is considerd as INVALID

1 regression = 1000 TC 

Why TestNG?
1)Batch Execution 
2)Group Execution
3)Verification
4)Parallel Execution
5)Report Genaration


3 Rules for TestNG
1.Should not use main method : @Test()
2.Default Package is not allowed : User defined Package
3. Should not use sysout(); : Reporter.log();

Batch execution is done by using TestNG.xml file
TestNG.xml : contains all test methods or Test Classes  which as to execute at a time
TestNG.xml = TestNG Suite

Can we have multiple Test() is single Class?
Yes
if yes the wt is order of execution?
Accroding to alphabetical order


How to execute in required order?
by using priority option

priority : is used to execute Test() in required Order(Has to be int,final,float values r not allowed)
dependsOnMethods : to execute Test() on sucuess of another Test()
enabled = false : to remove from Execuution
invocationCount : to execute  same Test() for  multiple Times (Has to be int,-ve float values r not allowed)
